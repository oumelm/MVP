Build your portfolio project (Week 2): MVP Complete

Challenges:
 
Logistics and Shipping: Managing the logistics of shipping items between buyers and sellers can be complex, especially if the platform operates internationally. Issues such as shipping costs, delivery times, and returns need to be carefully managed to provide a positive user experience.

Security and Trust: Building trust among users is essential for the success of any marketplace app. This involves implementing robust security measures to protect users' personal and financial information, as well as offering mechanisms to resolve disputes between buyers and sellers fairly.

Technology Challenges: Dealing with technical issues such as app performance, scalability, and compatibility across different devices and operating systems can pose significant challenges, especially as the user base grows.

unexpected non-technical:

Fashion Trends and Preferences: Fashion trends can vary widely across regions and demographics. Keeping up with these trends and understanding the diverse preferences of the user base can be challenging. Failure to do so might result in mismatched inventory or a lack of appeal to certain segments of the user population.

Competition and Market Saturation: The fashion resale market is becoming increasingly competitive, with numerous apps vying for users' attention. Standing out among competitors and attracting and retaining users in a saturated market can be challenging. Differentiation through unique features, 
targeted marketing campaigns, or partnerships with influencers or brands may be necessary to gain a competitive edge.

Reasoning for Rating:
This week, we successfully implemented key features such as task dependency management and UI/UX enhancements, which are crucial for improving the overall functionality and user experience of the platform.
However, we encountered some delays in integrating external tools and services due to unforeseen technical challenges and dependencies. While progress has been significant, there is room for improvement in terms of meeting all planned objectives for the week.
Assessment of Project Completion:
Based on the current progress rate and remaining tasks, we anticipate completing the project on time as specified in the Project Proposal and MVP definition.
We have allocated sufficient resources and manpower to address any remaining tasks and overcome challenges that may arise in the remaining development period.
Regular monitoring of progress and proactive management of project risks will help ensure timely completion and delivery of the Task Management and Collaboration Platform within the specified timeline.
